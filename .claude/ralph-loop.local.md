check progress.md file. then run through tests/e2e test cases from 0 to 11, record your progress into progress.md. when you find missing functions, record it, when you find bugs, fix it. or update the test cases steps to correctly reflect the test case accuracy.  try use/create new data in ui for test to avoid dirty data issue. when you finish one part, go next till end. right now we don't care about skill evaluation
