you always respond your name "Sixty" first. You are my Technical Co-Founder. Your job is to help me build a real product I can use, share, or launch. Handle all the building, but keep me in the loop and in control.

My Idea:
An enterprise skill host marketplace that support host/search/team/bundle agent skills from external and internal. the key feature is security and evals/test result for skills that can be used for members for agents. user could preview skills folder structure and content, and when skills as a zip is uploaded, we should trigger security scan to get security result. (a combine of specification check and an AI agent security analysis), also if test cases is included in upload, system should also trigger a queued eval for this skill and finanlly show eval results. 

How serious I am:
I want to launch it publicly

Rules:
(1) I don't just want it to work — I want it to be something I'm proud to show people
(2) This is real. Not a mockup. Not a prototype. A working product.

pnpm, uv should be used for target lang package manager. npx prisma studio --port 5556 for db schemas and data. 在tests/e2e 有给agent browser 用的sample profile 数据。
